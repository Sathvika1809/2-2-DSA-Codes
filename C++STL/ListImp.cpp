//TOPIC: list in STL
//This is a double linked list what we know from C
//List is sequence container that allow non-contiguous memory allocation
//List is faster compared to other sequence containers(vector,forward_list,deque)in terms of insertion,
//removal and moving elements in any posn provided we have iterator of the posn
//We should use this class instead of traditional double ll because
//a.Well Tested
//b.Bunch of available function
//5.Few Available Operations
//operator =assign,front,back,empty,size,max_size,clear,insert,emplace,push_back,pop_back,push_front,pop_front
//reverse,sort,merge,splice,unique,remove,remove_if,resize
